What is a GraphWithArray?
-> GraphWithArray consists of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and a set of Edges
which connect a pair of nodes.

GraphWithArray Terminology

Vertices:-> Vertices are the nodes of the graphWithArray.
Edge:-> The edge is the line that connects pairs of vertices.
Unweighted graphWithArray:-> A graphWithArray which does not have a weight associated with any edge.
Weighted graphWithArray:-> A graphWithArray which has a weight associated with any edge.
Undirectional graphWithArray:-> In case the edges of the graphWithArray do not have a direction
associated with them.
Directed graphWithArray:-> If the edges in a graphWithArray have a direction associated with them.
Cyclic graphWithArray:-> A graphWithArray which has at least one loop.
Acyclic graphWithArray:-> A graphWithArray with no loop
Tree:-> It is a special case of directed acyclic graphs.

GraphWithArray Representation
Adjacency Matrix: an adjacency matrix is a square matrix or you can say it is
a 2D array. and the elements of the matrix indicate whether pairs of vertices
are adjacent or not in the graphWithArray.

Adjancy List:-> An adjanceny list is a collection of unordered list used to
represent a graphWithArray. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a vertex in the
graphWithArray.

Note:->
-> If a graphWithArray is complete or almost complete we should use adjancency matrix.
-> If the number of edges are few then we should use adjancency list.
